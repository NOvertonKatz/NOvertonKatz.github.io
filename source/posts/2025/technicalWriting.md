# Technical Writing tips

As an early postdoc, I took a short course on technical writing in science with Jennifer Huber.

It had a lot of good takeaways I'm going to summarize here.

## Good writing
Follow the KISS principle = Keep It Simple Stupid
* Complex ideas don’t require complex language or overly-complex
sentences.
* Scientific writing should be easy and enjoyable to read.

As a great mentor once told me "I would have written a shorter message if I had the time." Expressing ideas concisely is an art, but makes for better communication.

Needless complexity makes scientific writing unclear. 
Get rid of:
* Needlessly complex words
Example: is capable of à can
* Needlessly complex phrases
Long strings of modifiers in front of nouns. Often a result of overusing jargon.
Example: We employed factor analysis data mining tools to identify linkage.
à
 We employed factor analysis to mine our data and identify linkage.
•Needlessly complex sentences
Long, convoluted sentences with too many ideas. Delete ideas that aren’t
important. Break into shorter sentences.
* Needless formality
Your goal is to inform not impress. You want to sound serious, precise,
authoritative, professional, and objective. But you can end up sounding
pretentious, vague, and dull.
* Double negatives
Example: They didn’t believe it was harmful. à They believed it was safe.
Redundancy
Example: new innovations vs. innovations, summarize briefly vs. summarize
* Needless intensifiers such as really, very, quite, extremely
Read sentence without intensifier to see if meaning is weakened or changed.
Omit intensifier or replace it with word that better conveys your meaning.
Example: The dogs were very eager to get off their leashes and really run.
The dogs were straining to get off their leashes and run free.
* Expletive constructions such as there is / it is
Example: There are twenty students who are taking this class.
Twenty students are taking this class.
 (more energy)
* Which / who clauses
Shortened to a simple adjective, if possible.
Example: Citizens who knew what was going on voted him out of office.
Informed citizens voted him out of office.
* Use fewer words
A large number of
 Many
Despite the fact that
 Although, despite
Each and every
 Each, every, all
Has the opportunity to
 Can, could
At this point in time
 Now
Compare and contrast
 Compare
In a case in which
 When, where
Due to the fact that
 Since, because
Give rise to
 Cause
Have an effect on
 Affect
 
Cutting unnecessary words in your own writing is more difficult.
* After investing a lot of effort to put words down onto the page, you often
don’t want to cut them. Don’t get too attached to your writing, the first version is always the worst a piece will be.

## Grammar
Lots of common mistakes to avoid, that can detract from otherwise good writing. 

“That” restricts and “which” qualifies:
* “That” is a restrictive pronoun used to introduce a restrictive clause.
Ø You can’t get rid of the clause without changing the basic meaning of the
sentence.
Ø A “that clause” doesn’t go inside commas.
Ø Example: “Chairs that don’t have cushions are uncomfortable to sit on.”
* “Which” is a nonrestrictive pronoun used to introduce a relative clause.
Ø You can eliminate the clause without altering the basic meaning of the
sentence. It provides additional, non-essential information.
Ø A “which clause” goes inside commas.
Ø Example: “I sat on an uncomfortable chair, which was in our conference
room.”

“That” restricts and “which” qualifies:
that
“Stroke incidence data are obtained from sources, which use the
International Code of Diseases classification systems.”
* Is the clause essential? Is it defining the subject (sources)?
* Yes à use “that”!

“Since” and “because” aren’t always interchangeable:
* “Since” usually refers to time
Ø Example: “Since I graduated, I’ve worked as a research scientist.”
Ø It can also refer to causation, but is  ambiguous.
Example: “Since they spoke, she’s had second thoughts.”
Was their talk the cause of the second thoughts? Or did the second
thoughts just occur later on?
* “Because” refers to causation
Ø Example: “The experiment could not be performed because the
equipment malfunctioned.”

* “Comprise”:
Ø Means to contain or include.
Ø The whole comprises all parts. (The whole comes first in the sentence.)
Ø Avoid “comprised of.” You wouldn’t say “contained of” or “included of.”
Ø Example: “A full pack comprises 52 playing cards.”
* “Compose”:
Ø Means to combine or to make up.
Ø The parts compose the whole.
Ø Example: “Many ethnic groups compose our nation.”
“Our nation is composed of many ethnic groups.”

“Affect” is usually a verb and “effect” is usually a noun:
* “Affect” is the verb “to influence.”
Ø Example: “The medication affected her.”
Ø Rarely, “affect” can be a noun that denotes feeling or emotion shown by
facial expression or body language. However, this is an obsolete usage.
Example: “His lack of affect made him seem like a shallow person.”
* “Effect” is the noun form of this influence.
Ø Example: “The medication had an effect on her.”
Ø “Effect” can also be a verb that means “to bring about” or “make happen.”
Example: “The organization hopes to effect a peace settlement.”

To avoid gender choice, make the sentence plural:
Examples:
* Each student worries about their grade.
* Students worry about their grades.

The word “data” is plural:
Examples:
* These data show an exponential increase.
* The data support the authors' conclusion.
* The data were difficult to analyze.

### Punctuation
* Missing commas à change the meaning
Ø Example:
 “John quit saying he was looking for another job.”
“John quit, saying he was looking for another job.”
Ø Speak the sentence out loud. Put commas where you pause or change gears.
* Too many commas à stilted sentences that are difficult to read
Ø Example: “I went to the store, but it was closed, so I got back into my car,
turned the radio on, then I backed out, and then I drove home.”
Ø Divide up a comma-filled sentence into 2 or 3 sentences.
* Don’t separate a subject from its verb with a comma
Ø Example: The smartest thing a writer can do, is learn to use commas correctly.

* Use commas to connect independent clauses joined by conjunctions: for,
and, nor, but, or, yet, & so
(Note: Sentence repeats the subject or uses two different subjects)
Ø Example:
 “Today is Thursday, and the report is due on Friday.”
* Don’t use a comma before a conjunction connecting a compound predicate
(Note: Sentence uses the same subject)
Ø Example: I reviewed the report and decided not to publish it.
* Use the Oxford Comma
Ø Use commas to separate a series of things or actions.
Ø The final comma just before the “and” or “or” is not grammatically necessary.
Be consistent. Follow the appropriate style guide.
Ø Example: “My favorite foods are cheese, bread, and chocolate.”

* * 
Hyphen (-):
Ø Connects two or more words into a single concept.
Examples: “He is a strong-willed scientist.”
“She used a 2-liter beaker to mix the chemicals.”
En Dash (–):
 (Macs: option -)
Ø Connects things that are related to each other by distance.
Example: “You will find the grammar tips in chapters 6–7.”
* Em Dash (—):
 (Macs: option shift -)
Ø A single em dash acts like a colon or comma.
Example: “He researched luminous blue variables — rare, massive stars that
shine up to a million times brighter than the Sun.”
Ø A pair acts like parentheses to enclose an aside or explanation.
Example: “Emergency situations — such as crushes, impacts, falls, and
burns — can occur during exploratory space missions.”

Colon:
Ø Introduces a list, if preceded by a clause that can stand alone.
Example: “He brought three wines: a Pinot Noir, a Cabernet, and a Merlot.”
Ø Don’t separate a verb from the rest of the sentence.
Example: “In his bag, he had: a Pinot Noir, a Cabernet, and a Merlot.”
* Semi-colon:
Ø Connects two independent clauses without an “and.”
Example: “We paid our dues; we expect the privileges listed in the contract.”
Ø Separates items in a series when there is already a comma in one or more
items.
Example: “The conference has attendees from Berkeley, California; Boulder,
Colorado; Chicago, Illinois; and many other places.”
Ø Use before namely, therefore, however, etc.
Example: “Select any two items; however, beakers and petri dishes are in
short supply.”

* Acronyms = words formed from the initial letters of a longer term.
Ø Use the term in full the first time and immediately follow it by the acronym in
parenthesis. Then use the acronym alone.
Example: National Institutes of Health (NIH)
Ø If you are only using an acronym once or twice, then write the term out in full
each time.

### Third person point of view
Academic writing maintains a third person point of view. This means the subject
pronouns he, she, they, it, or (less preferably) one are used instead of I or you.
Look at the following two sentences:
I hated the movie. You have to concentrate so hard just to keep all the names of
characters straight that you miss what's going on.
The first sentence, "I hated the movie," is an expression of the writer's personal
feelings. This would be fine in many rhetorical situations such as an online review,
but not for academic writing, which strives to be objective. When you are
expressing an opinion in academic writing, you still do not have to write, "I think."
You just have to give plenty of evidence supporting your position. The fact that
these are your thoughts on the subject is already presumed because your name is
on the paper. A more academic version of the first sentence simply introduces
what is wrong with the movie:
The movie has several major flaws that prevent it from truly engaging an audience.
In the next sentence of the example, the second person pronoun you is used as a
general pronoun meaning, "anyone watching the movie." This general you is used
regularly in conversation, especially when making statements of universal wisdom
("You reap what you sow." "You've got to start somewhere." "You never know.").
Because it is so commonly used, vigilance is necessary to avoid it in academic
writing. The general third person pronoun, one, can be used to replace it. However,
this often sounds stilted and is simply not the best wording of the sentence. Look at
this revision:
One has to concentrate so hard to keep all the names of characters straight that
one misses key plot points. ("What's going on," is also informal diction and has
been revised here.)
This sounds just as awkward as the first draft of the sentence. There are two better
ways to revise a sentence with a general you:
1. Think about a specific group of people the you actually refers to and use that as
the subject of the sentence:
The audience has to concentrate so hard to keep all the names of characters
straight that they miss key plot points.
2. Or look carefully at the sentence and decide what the main point really is. Then
revise the sentence to make the main point the subject:
An excess of characters obscures the plot.
This method may also help keep your writing concise and in active voice.

### Active voice
When writing, avoid using passive voice. Passive voice occurs when the
subject receives the action of the verb instead of performing it. “Be” verbs often
indicate passive voice.
For example:
* 
 The picture was drawn by Joseph.
In this case, the drawing is the subject and it is being acted upon by Joseph.
* 
 The ball was thrown to him.
* 
 The cat was chased by the dog.
* 
 He was given a trophy by the committee.
In each of these sentences, the subjects -- ”The ball”, “The cat”, “He”--are not
doing anything themselves. Each is having something happen to it--being thrown or
chased or given.
Always use active voice. Active voice occurs when the subject performs the action
of the verb.
For example:
* 
 Joseph draws a picture.
Joseph is the subject and he is doing something (drawing).
* 
 He threw the ball.
* 
 The dog chased the cat.
* 
 The committee gave him a trophy.
These sentences have been turned around so that the subjects --” He,” “The dog,”
“The committee” -- are each doing something.
Writing in active voice keeps your writing concise and lively. It makes prose
cleaner, clearer, and more direct. As you look at your sentences, make sure the
subject is acting and not being acted upon. Avoid forms of the verb “to be” such
as was, is, were, are. It helps to place subjects in front of the action they perform.
Consider revising any passive voice sentences in the following ways:
* 
 Change the sentence around.
The man was charged by the District Attorney.
The District Attorney charged the man.
* 
 Rewrite using a different verb.
He was given the key to the city.
He accepted the key to the city.
* 
 Be creative!
He was desperate to go to the concert.
In his desperation, he tried to sneak into the concert.
