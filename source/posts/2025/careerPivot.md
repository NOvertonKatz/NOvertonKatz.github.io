# Transitioning from Science track PostDoc to an Industry role

Work to live, don't live to work

Do something you are good at, enjoyment stems from confidenc



0. Personal fufillment
When it comes down to it, what parts of your life to you enjoy?

If you are lucky, I sure am, you enjoy parts of your career.

1. Do I want to be a good scientist vs great engineer
I have now spent what is now over a decade of time spent in the higher education and academic system, wow.

In the research and development (R&D) setting, there is a spectrum of what I will call capital R research R&d to capital D development r&D. The capital R research folks are all in on pushing the horizon of knowledge, and the capital D development want to make the best thing possible today. These things go hand in hand though, expanding the horizon make new things possible and better tools make expanding the horizon easier. By nature, R&D is hard. It requires a lot of effort, training, and specialization. So most groups and individuals have to find what side they fall on, research heavy or development heavy.

Early in a career, most people start at something like a r&d work. Not really specialized either way, and certainly not leading efforts in either direction.

3. AI
AI is, or at least should be, on every knowledge workers radar 2025. Regardless of whether you think its on route to the singularity or just simply a new fad, there is no denying it is here now and is only going to get better and more pervasive. So as a fairly early career person, what can you do? 
I rather like Nate Silvers article on this

Note he is a technical guy and practical guys, but by no means not involved in AI work. The short take away? Make sure you are ahead of the curve. No one knows what road AI is taking us down, but regardless the absolute worst palace to be is the back of the pack for fear of being left behind.

So back to the question, what do you do? Position yourself at least in the vicinity of AI developments, avoid positions that are already seeing AI acceleration, prioritize transferable personal growth, and be ready to pivot quickly.

Who wins, no matter what AI does? The people selling AI hardware.

4. Politics
Despite all this, I was still on the fence. But eventually something would nudge me one way or another. Enter the political climate in the US early 2024, which was not so much a nudge as a full on body check.

It was suddenly exceptionally clear that science will not be a priority in the US for the next 4 years, best case. Not only does that make growing a career in science difficult, but the plans of most established scientist around me started to mostly look like how to survive with minimal casualties. Scarier still, I was seeing a lot of good scientist show signs of jumping ship. I love science work, but not enough to put my career and well being on the line for it.
