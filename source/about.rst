About
=====
Currently, I work as a postdoc at `Lawrence Berkeley National Lab <https://www.lbl.gov/>`_, as part of a team developing high-order embedded boundary methods.

I graduated with my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Colorado State University in 2022, where my `dissertation <https://mountainscholar.org/browse/author?scope=0381b78d-3f19-4bf6-9c19-74081e24fe1a>`_ focused on geometry representation and meshing for CFD (computational fluid dynamics) algorithms.
