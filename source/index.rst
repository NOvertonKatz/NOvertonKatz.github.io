Nate Overton-Katz
=================
Hi, I am Nate Overton-Katz! I'm a research software engineer, and generally interested in all things high performance computing and numerical methods.

About me
^^^^^^^^
Currently, I work as a postdoc at `Lawrence Berkeley National Lab <https://www.lbl.gov/>`_, as part of a team developing high-order embedded boundary methods.

I graduated with my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Colorado State University in 2022, where my `dissertation <https://mountainscholar.org/browse/author?scope=0381b78d-3f19-4bf6-9c19-74081e24fe1a>`_ focused on geometry representation and meshing for CFD (computational fluid dynamics) algorithms.

You can also find me

,and my academic publications
`on Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dIQKKpcAAAAJ>`_.

About this site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In short, this site exists to summarize *things I have learned*, and *projects I have worked on*. There is lots of information readily available online on almost any topic, and reproducing much of that is simply a poor use of time. Instead, my goal here is to summarize topics that have taken me effort to comprehend, collect useful resources, demonstrate examples I find useful, and potentially add insight. With that goal in mind, I aim to include references whenever reasonable.

If you find anything useful here, feel free to reach out, I would love to chat!
