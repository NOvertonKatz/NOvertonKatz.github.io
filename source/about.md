## Career
Currently, I work as a postdoc at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), as part of a team developing high-order embedded boundary methods. I have been very fortunate to work with Hans Johansen, who has been an excellent advisor and mentor for me.

I graduated with my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Colorado State University in 2022, where my [dissertation](https://mountainscholar.org/browse/author?scope=0381b78d-3f19-4bf6-9c19-74081e24fe1a) focused on geometry representation and meshing for CFD (computational fluid dynamics) algorithms.
Previously, I graduated with my bachelors in mechanical engineering in 2016.

, and my academic publications
[on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dIQKKpcAAAAJ). I try to keep both of these up to date.

## This site
In short, this site exists to summarize *things I have learned*, and *projects I have worked on*. There is lots of information readily available online on almost any topic, and reproducing much of that is simply a poor use of time. Instead, my goal here is to summarize topics that have taken me effort to comprehend, collect useful resources, demonstrate examples I find useful, and potentially add insight. With that goal in mind, I aim to include references whenever reasonable.

If you find anything useful here, feel free to reach out, I would love to chat!
